On the whole, a perfectly pleasant piece. It opens with a clear soprano solo, which could be ideal for a treble also, before progressing to full choir and finally adding the organ once again, in very a predictable fashion. Whilst simple, interest is nonetheless developed in the harmony throughout the piece. However, the organ interludes start in a somewhat clunky manner, with a falling tritone appearing out of the blue, though it quickly returns to the safety of predictability.

The tenors are periodically given some quick jumps, which generally feel out of place when they occur. There is also a dogged insistence to hold steady at cadences within verses, rather than allowing the basses to progress to the seventh. This leads to a piece of music which, whilst perfectly acceptable, could be much improved with only a few minor tweaks. This is exemplified in the organ postlude, which brings some much-needed musical development to the ideas presented, albeit far too late.

Overall, this would still make for a reasonable addition to the repertoire of both less experienced choirs and smaller chamber groups, adding a quieter and more reflective piece of music to the mix.
