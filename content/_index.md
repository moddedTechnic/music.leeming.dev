Through my involvement with various choirs, I have listened to a wide variety of choral music. Much of this music comes from the English tradition, however it has been augmented by music from other European cultures.

This blog is an experiment to document my thoughts about the pieces I have listened to. I hope that, as it matures, it will become a useful resource that adds to the discussion of the nature and temperament of a wide variety of choral works.
