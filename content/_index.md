Through my involvement with various choirs, I have had the pleasure in listening to a great deal of choral music, particularly that of the English tradition -- though it has often been augmented by a generous portion from the smorgasbord that makes up much of the European tradition.

Naturally, one holds opinions about music encountered. This blog is an experiment, to document my thoughts about such pieces. As it matures, it shall hopefully develop into a bank of knowledge as to the nature and temperament of a wide variety of works.
